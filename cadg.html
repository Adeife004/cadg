                    Christ Ambassador Drama Group was founded Early May 2023, by Olawale Iremide Suliamon who is a well dedicated and born-again in christ. Olawale Iremide started the drama by making vidoes with his fellow collegues( Mr. Akuna Godbless, Miss. Glory CarisHub and Miss Oluwaseun )who have dedicated their time and support to the mandate and whom God is using to make CADG grow. Christ Ambassador Drama Group aims to preach the gospel through making of either stage drama or movies.
                    The reason and the purpose of this mandate can be seen from the book of 2Cor 5:20 -{We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God.}
